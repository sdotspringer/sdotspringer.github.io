Software Engineering and Management student at the TU Graz.

Currently in my third semester of studies, with a strong motivation and improvement drive.
Alongside my studies, I work part-time as an optician in an eye doctor’s office.

> My academic work exclusively happens on GitLab. Additionally, working a part-time job limits the time I can dedicate to personal GitHub projects.
